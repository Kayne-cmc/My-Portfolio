        Hi, I'm Kayne and I am a 2A Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I love a nice relaxing day of coding or skateboarding but most of all I love learning new things!<br></br> Ever since I was a kid, I was always interested in how things worked. Whether its a solution or a design, every problem or difficult situation that I encounter, I would come up with a solution in my head. Without the proper experience, I was unable to make my designs come to life. As a future engineer I still hold the same goal I had as a child-to create awesome things that help others.
