			Growing up in Richmond Hill, I watched my dadâ€™s creativity unfold as he
			would be working on something new every week. Whether it was a
			renovation for the house, a new skateboard obstacle for my brother and
			me, or a fishing gadget for himself, my dad always kept himself busy. As
			a kid who couldn't even use a power drill (and I still struggle
			sometimes), I was amazed by his work and aspired to be creative like
			him. Now as a future engineer, I hold the same goal that I had as a kid
			- to explore my imagination and create amazing things.
